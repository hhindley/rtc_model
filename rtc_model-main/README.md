# A mechanistic model of Rtc-regulated RNA repair suggests molecular targets to potentiate antibiotic effects

## Provided here is the code defining and solving the models used in the paper.

### models folder
- includes all model versions (Rtc, tRNA and inhibition models).
  
### funcs.jl 
- includes all functions needed that are used within other files.
  
### params.jl 
- includes all parameter values as used to get results.

### run_model.jl 
- provides all information needed to solve each model with and without damage.
  
### bifurcation.jl 
- provides all information needed to obtain the bistability result in the Rtc and tRNA models.
